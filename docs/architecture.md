## 1. System Overview

Family Flow follows a **decoupled architecture** with separate frontend and backend projects that communicate via a well-documented REST API. This allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of each component while maintaining simplicity and lightweight operation.

### 1.1 Architecture Principles
- **Simplicity First:** Minimal complexity to ensure easy maintenance and family-friendly usage
- **Role-Based Access:** Clear separation between parent and child capabilities
- **Lightweight:** Fast loading and minimal resource usage
- **Mobile-First:** Responsive design prioritizing mobile devices


## 2. Technical Requirements

- **Platform:** Web application with mobile-first responsive design
- **Tech Stack:**
  - **Frontend:** React with TypeScript for type safety
  - **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js framework
  - **Database:** SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
  - **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
  - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive design
- **Hosting:** 
  - Frontend: Vercel or Netlify
  - Backend: Railway, Render, or similar Node.js hosting
  - Database: Built-in SQLite or managed PostgreSQL
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive setup guides and API documentation

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

**Detailed implementation specifications:**
- **Frontend Architecture:** See [frontend.md §2 Frontend Architecture](frontend.md#2-frontend-architecture) for component structure, state management, and UI design
- **Backend Architecture:** See [backend.md §1 Backend Architecture](backend.md#1-backend-architecture) and [§3 API Design](backend.md#3-api-design)

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management and logout functionality

### 4.2 Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through proper output encoding
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### 4.3 Privacy
- Minimal data collection
- Family data isolation
- No third-party analytics or tracking

## 5. Development & Deployment

### 5.1 Development Environment Setup
- **Prerequisites:** Node.js, npm/yarn, Git
- **Database:** SQLite for development (automatic initialization)
- **Environment Variables:** `.env` file with configuration
- **Running Locally:** `npm run dev` for both frontend and backend
- **Testing:** Unit tests and integration tests for critical paths

### 5.2 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Component and service-level testing
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoint testing with database
- **E2E Tests:** User workflow testing
- **Testing Tools:** Jest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend

### 5.3 Data Migration
- **Database Migrations:** Version-controlled schema changes
- **Migration Tools:** To be defined
- **Backup Strategy:** Regular database backups before migrations
- **Rollback Plan:** Ability to rollback migrations if needed
